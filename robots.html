    <p id="robot">Being an active member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team <a href="https://www.ghouse354.com/" target="_blank">354 G-House Pirates</a> during the competition in 2023 was our
         team's true comeback by having a decently sized team and also two of our alumni coming back as mentors we were able to build a far better robot which turned out to be a stronger and super fast robot compared
          to 2022 which we only had 2 students and a smaller room. <br>
        <br>
        For 2024 we are working on competing for 2 one on NYC Regional which is a 6-week competition and at Hudson Valley which is a 2 week competition and also getting our students more 
        practice with tools and getting them more experience in both designing and building. <br> <br>
