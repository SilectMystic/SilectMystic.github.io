    <p id="robot">Being an active member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team <a href="https://www.ghouse354.com/" target="_blank">354 G-House Pirates</a> during competition of 2022 which was one of the most
        difficult years for our team since we had only two 
        students who where working on the robots and also being on a different room that didnt have that much space since the team got
        kicked out of their old room so they had to use what we had for that year. <br>
        For 2023 we are working on training brand new studends on building the next competition robot that we are planing to use and also 
        getting them used to working with power tools and teaching them way more. <br> <br>
