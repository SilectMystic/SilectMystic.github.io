    <p id="robot">Being an active member of FIRST Robotics Competition Team <a href="https://www.ghouse354.com/" target="_blank">354 G-House Pirates</a> during the competition in 2022 which 
        was one of the most difficult years for our team since we had only two students who were working on the robots and also were in a different room that didn't have that much space 
        since the team got kicked out of their old room so they had to use what we had for that year. <br>
        <br>
        For 2023 we are working on training brand new students on building the next competition robot that we are planning to use and also getting them used to 
        working with power tools and teaching them way more. <br> <br>
