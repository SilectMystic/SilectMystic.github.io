    <h1> Welcome to the website</h1> <hr>
    <p>Hi, I'm Carlos Vasquez, and I'm a student at the George Westinghouse Highschool and also at the STEAM Center, 
        Full-Stack Development Pathway. Something about me is that I like studying about technology for as much as I can and want to 
        learn more about it. I participate in a lot of programs when they are available like internships and participate in FIRST 
        Robotics Competition as the current student Team Captain of Team 354 and also being one of the managers for Westinghouse 
        JV Basketball team.</p>
